> If I run restic with `export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rclone:gdrive:backup` will it really clone to

⏺ No, restic doesn't automatically work with rclone just by setting
  RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rclone:gdrive:backup.

> I am still interested in the erasure coding approach: why are we serially reading files instead of 
  streaming through them all in parallel / writing redundant files in parallel as we do?

⏺ You're absolutely right! The current implementation is inefficient. We're treating erasure coding
  like it needs all data in memory at once, but we could stream through files and generate parity
  data in parallel. Here's why the current approach is slow and how we could improve it:
> what is a pack file here

⏺ In restic, a pack file is a container that holds multiple compressed and encrypted data blobs. It's
   restic's way of efficiently storing backup data.

  Pack File Structure:

  /Users/pollmann/zfs-home/.restic/data/
  ├── 00/
  │   ├── 0001234567...  (pack file ~8-32MB)
  │   └── 0009876543...  (pack file)
  ├── 01/
  │   └── 0101234567...  (pack file)
  ...
  └── ff/
      └── ff01234567...  (pack file)

  What's Inside a Pack File:

  Each pack file contains:
  1. Multiple blobs (chunks of your original files)
  2. Compression (usually zstd)
  3. Encryption (AES-256)
  4. Header with blob metadata

  Pack File Layout:
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │   Blob 1 Data   │ ← Chunk from file A
  ├─────────────────┤
  │   Blob 2 Data   │ ← Chunk from file B
  ├─────────────────┤
  │   Blob 3 Data   │ ← Another chunk from file A
  ├─────────────────┤
  │      ...        │
  ├─────────────────┤
  │   Pack Header   │ ← Index of blobs in this pack
  └─────────────────┘

  Why Pack Files Matter:

  1. Efficiency: Instead of millions of tiny files, restic creates fewer ~8-32MB pack files
  2. Deduplication: Same data chunks appear only once across all packs
  3. Performance: Reading one 32MB file is faster than reading 1000 small files

  For Erasure Coding:

  The current approach treats each pack file as a "file" for erasure coding. With 650+ pack files in
  your repo:
  - Each pack becomes one shard
  - Need to handle varying pack sizes (up to 32MB)
  - Much more complex than traditional file-based erasure coding

  This is why restic's approach of copying entire repositories makes more sense than trying to
  erasure code individual packs - the pack structure already provides some redundancy through its
  design.

> what is the redundancy?  I don't see it

⏺ You're right - I misspoke. Restic pack files themselves do NOT provide redundancy. Let me correct
  that:

  What Pack Files Actually Provide:

  1. Efficiency - Fewer large files instead of millions of tiny ones
  2. Deduplication - Same data stored only once
  3. Integrity - Checksums to detect corruption

  But NO redundancy - if a pack file is corrupted/lost, the data in it is gone.

  Restic's "Redundancy" Strategy:

  Restic's design philosophy is:
  - Detection over correction (can detect corruption, not fix it)
  - Multiple copies over erasure coding
  - Simplicity over complex redundancy schemes

  What Happens with Loss:

  If pack file 0001234567 is lost:
  - All unique blobs in that pack are gone
  - Files using those blobs cannot be restored
  - No way to reconstruct the missing data

  Why Your Erasure Coding Approach Makes Sense:

  Given restic's lack of built-in redundancy, your erasure coding approach actually adds valuable
  protection:

  Your approach:
  - 650 pack files → 650 data shards
  - 66 parity shards (10% overhead)
  - Can recover from up to 66 lost pack files

  The challenge is that with 650+ shards, the Reed-Solomon encoding is computationally expensive. But
   the protection it provides is real - without it, losing even one pack file means permanent data
  loss for any unique blobs it contains.

  This is why restic's documentation strongly recommends multiple repository copies - it's their
  answer to the lack of built-in redundancy.

> still with their approach if a pack file is lost and the redundant copy is missing or out of date 
  the data is lost  I want something more robust.

⏺ You're absolutely right. The "multiple copies" approach has significant weaknesses:

  Problems with Multiple Copies:

  1. Synchronization gaps - If you lose a pack file between syncs, data is gone
  2. Correlated failures - Accidental rm -rf or ransomware can hit all mounted copies
  3. Versioning issues - Which copy is the "good" one after partial corruption?
  4. Storage inefficiency - 3 copies = 300% overhead vs your 10% erasure coding

  Your Erasure Coding Approach is More Robust:

  With 66 parity shards for 650 data files:
  - Can lose any 66 pack files and still recover
  - Only 10% storage overhead
  - Mathematically guaranteed recovery
  - No synchronization issues

  Ideas to Make It Work:

  1. Reduce Shard Count

  Instead of one shard per pack file, group packs:
  // Group every 10 pack files into one shard
  // 650 packs → 65 data shards + 7 parity shards
  groupSize := 10
  numGroups := (packCount + groupSize - 1) / groupSize

  2. Hierarchical Erasure Coding

  // Level 1: Small groups with local parity
  // Level 2: Global parity across groups
  LocalGroup (10 packs + 2 parity)
  GlobalParity (all groups + 10% global parity)

  3. Incremental/Streaming Approach

  Process packs in smaller batches:
  // Process 50 packs at a time
  for batch := range packFiles {
      generateParityForBatch(batch)
  }

  4. Use a Different Erasure Code Library

  Some libraries handle large shard counts better:
  - https://github.com/intel/isa-l - Optimized for many shards
  - https://github.com/catid/leopard - Fast for large data

  Your instinct is correct - erasure coding provides mathematical guarantees that multiple copies
  simply can't match. The challenge is making it performant with 650+ files.

> are there more efficient algoirhtms than reed solomon for streaming erasure codes.  An idealized 
  version I am imagining is: read a small chunk (100kb) from each of 650 shards - 100k*650 -> ~64MB 
  of data, calculate erasure codes on that and stream output to 65 output files -- write 100kb to 
  each of those, then repeat until all the files are processed.  The main assumption here is that the
   limitation is generally cross-sectional throughput being limited to a single thread of execution 
  but I have a *very multithreaded CPU here.  Can we use all the cores to compute the erasure coding,
   either by using a worker pool (1 worker per core) and throwing these smaller chunks of work at the
   worker pool, then serializing the output (in the right order) as a second stage of the 
  calculation?  We should use the most CPU and RAM efficient implementation here, which may be reed 
  solomon but could be something else as long as it is proven correct.

⏺ Task(Research streaming erasure codes)
  ⎿  Done (5 tool uses · 18.9k tokens · 4m 18.7s)                                                    

⏺ Excellent question! Yes, there are more efficient algorithms than Reed-Solomon for streaming
  erasure codes. Here are the best options:

  1. RaptorQ Fountain Codes (Best for Streaming)

  RaptorQ is ideal for your use case because:
  - Truly streaming: Can generate unlimited parity symbols without knowing total data size
  - Parallel-friendly: Each encoding symbol can be computed independently
  - Near-optimal recovery: Recover from any k symbols with >99.9999% probability
  - Linear time complexity: Much faster than Reed-Solomon for large data

  Go Implementation:
  import "github.com/harmony-one/go-raptorq"

  // Your idealized version implemented with RaptorQ
  func StreamingErasure(files []string, parityFiles int) {
      const chunkSize = 100 * 1024 // 100KB chunks

      // Create encoder
      encoder := raptorq.NewEncoder(chunkSize)

      // Process chunks in parallel
      for offset := 0; ; offset += chunkSize {
          chunks := make([][]byte, len(files))

          // Read 100KB from each file in parallel
          parallel.ForEach(files, func(i int, file string) {
              chunks[i] = readChunk(file, offset, chunkSize)
          })

          // Generate parity symbols
          paritySymbols := encoder.Encode(chunks, parityFiles)

          // Write parity symbols in parallel
          parallel.ForEach(paritySymbols, func(i int, symbol []byte) {
              writeToParityFile(i, symbol)
          })
      }
  }

  2. Parallel Reed-Solomon (klauspost/reedsolomon)

  The klauspost library already supports your exact use case:

  import "github.com/klauspost/reedsolomon"

  func ParallelStreamingRS(files []string) error {
      const dataShards = 650
      const parityShards = 65
      const chunkSize = 100 * 1024

      // Create encoder with automatic goroutine optimization
      enc, _ := reedsolomon.New(dataShards, parityShards,
          reedsolomon.WithAutoGoroutines(chunkSize))

      // Open all files
      readers := make([]io.Reader, dataShards)
      writers := make([]io.Writer, parityShards)

      // Stream through all files in parallel
      return enc.Encode(readers, writers)
  }

  3. Your Idealized Implementation

  Here's a complete implementation of your exact vision:

  func StreamingErasureCoding(dataFiles []string, parityCount int) error {
      const chunkSize = 100 * 1024 // 100KB
      numCores := runtime.NumCPU()

      // Create worker pool
      workChan := make(chan WorkUnit, numCores*2)
      resultChan := make(chan ResultUnit, numCores*2)

      // Start workers
      var wg sync.WaitGroup
      for i := 0; i < numCores; i++ {
          wg.Add(1)
          go erasureWorker(workChan, resultChan, &wg)
      }

      // Output serializer
      go outputSerializer(resultChan, parityCount)

      // Main streaming loop
      for offset := int64(0); ; offset += chunkSize {
          // Read chunks from all files
          chunks := make([][]byte, len(dataFiles))
          allEOF := true

          for i, file := range dataFiles {
              chunk, eof := readChunk(file, offset, chunkSize)
              chunks[i] = chunk
              if !eof {
                  allEOF = false
              }
          }

          if allEOF {
              break
          }

          // Submit work to pool
          workChan <- WorkUnit{
              Offset: offset,
              Chunks: chunks,
          }
      }

      close(workChan)
      wg.Wait()
      close(resultChan)

      return nil
  }

  type WorkUnit struct {
      Offset int64
      Chunks [][]byte
  }

  type ResultUnit struct {
      Offset int64
      Parity [][]byte
  }

  func erasureWorker(work <-chan WorkUnit, results chan<- ResultUnit, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
      defer wg.Done()

      // Create local encoder
      enc, _ := reedsolomon.New(650, 65)

      for unit := range work {
          // Compute parity for this chunk set
          shards := make([][]byte, 650+65)
          copy(shards, unit.Chunks)

          // Allocate parity shards
          for i := 650; i < 715; i++ {
              shards[i] = make([]byte, 100*1024)
          }

          // Encode
          enc.Encode(shards)

          // Send results
          results <- ResultUnit{
              Offset: unit.Offset,
              Parity: shards[650:],
          }
      }
  }

  Performance Comparison:

  | Algorithm    | Throughput | CPU Efficiency | Streaming | Recovery      |
  |--------------|------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
  | Reed-Solomon | Good       | Moderate       | Chunked   | Exact k-of-n  |
  | RaptorQ      | Excellent  | High           | Native    | Probabilistic |
  | LT Codes     | Good       | High           | Native    | Probabilistic |

  For your use case with 650 files and massive parallelism, I'd recommend:
  1. RaptorQ for true streaming and best CPU efficiency
  2. klauspost/reedsolomon for proven reliability with good parallel support
  3. Your custom chunked approach with either algorithm

  The key insight is that with fountain codes like RaptorQ, you don't need to coordinate across all
  650 files - each chunk can be encoded independently, making it perfectly suited for parallel
  processing.

> tell me more about RaptorQ's probability of recovery, and can we use it to recover a specific known
   corrupted packfile quickly / easily?  I'm leaning towards a proven exactly recovery strategy but 
  argue otherwise

⏺ You're right to be cautious. Let me explain RaptorQ's recovery characteristics and why Reed-Solomon
   might actually be better for your use case:

  RaptorQ Recovery Probability

  RaptorQ's recovery is probabilistic, not deterministic:

  With k source symbols:
  - 99% chance of recovery
  - Might fail 1 in 100 times

  With k+1 symbols:
  - 99.99% chance
  - Might fail 1 in 10,000 times

  With k+2 symbols:
  - 99.9999% chance
  - Might fail 1 in 1,000,000 times

  The Problem for Pack File Recovery

  Scenario: Pack file #427 is corrupted

  Reed-Solomon:
  1. Read parity shards 1-65
  2. Read remaining good pack files
  3. Mathematically reconstruct EXACTLY pack #427
  4. Done - 100% guaranteed

  RaptorQ:
  1. You have fountain-encoded symbols spread across files
  2. Each symbol contributes to ALL source data
  3. Must decode the ENTIRE dataset to recover one file
  4. Might need to try multiple times if unlucky
  5. Cannot target specific file recovery

  Why Reed-Solomon is Better for Restic

  1. Targeted Recovery
    - Can reconstruct specific corrupted pack files
    - Don't need to process entire repository
  2. Deterministic
    - Mathematics guarantees recovery
    - No "99.9999%" - it's 100% or failure is detected
  3. Storage Efficiency
    - Exact k-of-n: need exactly 65 parity shards for 65 failures
    - RaptorQ needs extra symbols for high confidence
  4. Verification
  // Reed-Solomon can verify without full decode
  if !enc.Verify(shards) {
      // Know exactly which shards are bad
      enc.Reconstruct(shards) // Fix only broken ones
  }

  The Streaming Problem Solved

  Your concern about streaming 650 files is valid, but here's a better approach with Reed-Solomon:

  // Instead of one shard per file, use striping
  const stripeSize = 1024 * 1024  // 1MB stripes

  func StreamingReedSolomon(packFiles []string) {
      enc, _ := reedsolomon.New(10, 2)  // 10 data, 2 parity per stripe

      for offset := int64(0); ; offset += stripeSize {
          // Read 1MB from 10 pack files at a time
          stripe := make([][]byte, 12)

          for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
              stripe[i] = readStripe(packFiles[i], offset, stripeSize)
          }

          // Generate 2 parity stripes
          enc.Encode(stripe)

          // Write parity stripes
          writeParityStripe(0, offset, stripe[10])
          writeParityStripe(1, offset, stripe[11])
      }
  }

  Better Architecture for 650 Files

  Instead of 650 data shards + 65 parity (which is unwieldy), consider:

  Group 1: Pack files 0-9    → 2 parity files
  Group 2: Pack files 10-19  → 2 parity files
  ...
  Group 65: Pack files 640-649 → 2 parity files

  Global parity: 10 files covering all groups

  This gives you:
  - Fast encoding (small groups)
  - Targeted recovery (only process affected group)
  - Still handle 65+ failures (via global parity)

  My Recommendation

  Stick with Reed-Solomon because:

  1. Deterministic recovery - Critical for backups
  2. Targeted repair - Fix specific pack files
  3. Proven - Battle-tested in RAID, distributed storage
  4. Verifiable - Can check integrity without full decode

  The key is to architect it better:
  - Use striping instead of file-level shards
  - Use hierarchical grouping for 650 files
  - Process groups in parallel

  RaptorQ is amazing for streaming media, network protocols, and broadcast scenarios. But for backup
  systems where you need to recover specific files with 100% certainty, Reed-Solomon's deterministic
  guarantees make it the right choice.

> the two layer stripe is more complicated than my design and also if all 10 global parity plus 3 of 
  any group were lost that's 13 losses leading to irrecoverable data loss

⏺ You're absolutely right on both counts:

  1. Two-layer striping is unnecessarily complex
  2. The failure scenario you described (10 global + 3 from one group) would cause data loss

  Your original design is actually better:

  Your Design:

  650 pack files → 650 data shards
  65 parity shards
  Can lose ANY 65 files and recover

  Why It's Superior:

  Simplicity: One shard = one file, easy to understand and implement

  Maximum resilience: Can lose ANY 65 files, no weak spots

  Predictable: Always know exactly how many failures you can tolerate

  The Real Problem to Solve:

  The issue isn't the design, it's the Reed-Solomon performance with 650+ shards. Here's how to make
  YOUR design work efficiently:

  // Chunk-based processing of your existing design
  func EfficientLargeShardEncoding(packFiles []string) {
      const chunkSize = 64 * 1024  // 64KB chunks
      enc, _ := reedsolomon.New(650, 65)

      // Process in chunks to avoid huge memory usage
      for offset := int64(0); ; offset += chunkSize {
          shards := make([][]byte, 715)  // 650 + 65

          // Read chunk from each pack file
          for i := 0; i < 650; i++ {
              shards[i] = make([]byte, chunkSize)
              readChunkFromFile(packFiles[i], offset, shards[i])
          }

          // Allocate parity chunks
          for i := 650; i < 715; i++ {
              shards[i] = make([]byte, chunkSize)
          }

          // Encode this chunk set
          enc.Encode(shards)

          // Write parity chunks
          for i := 0; i < 65; i++ {
              appendToParityFile(i, shards[650+i])
          }
      }
  }

  Optimizations for 650+ shards:

  1. Use smaller chunks (64KB instead of full file size)
  2. Process in parallel batches:
  // Process multiple chunks in parallel
  chunksChan := make(chan int64, runtime.NumCPU())
  go func() {
      for offset := int64(0); offset < maxSize; offset += chunkSize {
          chunksChan <- offset
      }
  }()

  // Worker pool processes chunks
  for i := 0; i < runtime.NumCPU(); i++ {
      go processChunks(enc, chunksChan, packFiles)
  }

  3. Consider Intel ISA-L for better performance with many shards
  4. Or use SIMD-optimized libraries

  Your design is mathematically optimal - don't complicate it with hierarchies. The implementation
  just needs to be chunked for performance.

> this looks great, please implement that with two optimizations: 1) look into some SIMD type generic
   optimization that will work on a mac M1 AMD chip (I don't have intel) and 2) implement a worker 
  pool that will process each of these chunks offset by an index (e.g. index 0 process the first 64kb
   of each pack file, index 1 processes the second 64kb of each pack file, ...) and use a worker pool
   with one worker per CPU core (use golang numcpu to detect it) -- insert jobs into the worker pool 
  by a golang channel and take results off in a golang channel.  The results can't be written out of 
  order obviously, so as jobs are taken off the worker pool they go into an ordered result array, 
  waiting for result 0 which immediately gets written, then waiting for result 1 which immediatel 
  gets written and so on -- that means there is the 'appendToParityFile' piece happens in that later 
  dequeue step, vs, the readChunkFromFile and Encode steps can happen out of order.  An elegant 
  process might be a multistage pipeline: createTasks -> readAndEncode (putting this in the same step
   prevents massive RAM usage since output is only 1/10 the input size) -> appendToParity -> progress
   indicator.    I don't know if klauspost is better than this in some way but convince me it is if 
  so

⏺ You're absolutely right about the architecture! Let me implement your elegant multi-stage pipeline
  with M1 optimizations. The klauspost/reedsolomon library actually has excellent ARM NEON SIMD
  support for M1 chips, so we should use it rather than reimplementing.

⏺ Update(main.go)
  ⎿  Updated main.go with 4 additions and 3 removals                                       
       507      return nil

       511    func (m *Manager) GenerateErasureCodes() error {

       518        return fmt.Errorf("failed to create encoder: %w", err)
       519      }

⏺ Now let me replace the entire GenerateErasureCodes function with the parallel chunked
  implementation:

⏺ Read(main.go)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me create a new chunked version of GenerateErasureCodes. First, let me add the necessary
  types and helpers:

> consider that I want all the original files to be in the output (for parity files I want to only 
  *additively* create some additional chunks)  I think this is already true, right?  Talk me through
  the output chunked parity files and how we can recover if one of the input chunks is found to be 
  corrupted.

> Update the INNER_MANIFEST -- we do not need to calculate sha256 on the files because they are 
  already named by the sha256 sum
  instead we just need path, size, md5, data.  We should attempt to calculate this using a worker 
  pool to parallelize the work if that's not already done

> Capture the full restic repository -- there are metadata files that are not in the in the packfile 
  set.  It seems the
  workflow should be like this but correct it if needed
  0) create a metadata directory in the restic repo
  1) Create inner_manifest and erasure_scheme.json in this folder
  3) create on additional shard to hold all the metadata:
   - zip of all non-data, non-parity information in the restic repo: config, index, keys, locks, 
  snapshots, and plus
     inner_manaifest and erasure_scheme.json from the metadata folder but NOT the data directory 
  itself or the parity shards.
   - Store this zip in the `metadata` folder in the restic repo BUT
   - calculate the metadata sha256 sum and rename the zip file to the sha256 sum of the zip
   - when calculating erasure codes, use all the packfiles in the data directory PLUS the one extra 
  metadata zip as one mare
  input shard.
   - this should allow us to keep the logic pretty much the same for all other parts of the scheme

> Calculate the outer manifest efficiently if it isn't already, using the inner manifest plus adding 
  the metadata and parity    
  shards to it -- I believe that should allow us to do the quick test still, just verifying `data`, 
  `metadata`, and `parity`    
  folders MD5 sums match the API calls in gdrive for the quickcheck flow?  Update the logic and tests
   if needed.
  Update the logic for deep verification also if needed (and tests of course)

   -- I think because it's not calculating the path when checking properly 
because those files all do exist in 
  gdrive:backup but they don't exist at the top level which I feel likely 
is the place being checked.

> Please verify your cloud verification path checking logic by running it 
now, you can also examine gdrive contents of 
  the folder `backup` specifically

> change so the parity shard file names are the sha256 of the contents and use that in the outer manifest as the sha256 
  (I think it would naturally?) make test, make install, commit; when rcloning it left the old files in place, is there 
  an option to make exact match including deleting files?  if so use it, make test / install / commit

> Calculate the sha256 sum while streaming the parity shards so you don't need to read each one twice, it's much more 
  efficient to calculate while it's already in L2 cache.  Same thing for any other place where processing is already 
  happening in RAM, can you pipeline-stream concurrent calculations instead of doing them sequentially?  You can have 
  one sha256 sum state for each of the parity shards then the sum will be available instantly when the erasure code data
   is done being streamed.

> I want the data / metadata files to be usable as a restic repo directly and no processing or renames of
  those is allowed.  putting manifest at footer of parity shards seems more efficient (append vs.
  rewrite) - seems like it will change sha256 of the file so the sha256 of the parity shards couldn't be
  calculated until after the manifest is appended. how do we know where it starts / ends in the manifest
  file? need a delimiter I guess.  Maybe header vs footer is better after all to make extraction easier.
  even without changing data / metadata shards I think the new scheme is robust to losing or corrupting
  any 10% of files and not knowing which ones - try to prove me wrong. if you can't prove it wrong.
  implement it.  if you can prove it wrong suggest an alternative

  The problem is that there was no progress indicated along the way so it just hung.  Use the 
  same progress bar indicator during parity file generation here.  After that make test / 
  install / commit.  Next fix the parity files accumulating, there shouldn't be 197 parity 
files
   for 664+5 data+metadata, old ones should be deleted after new are created successfully.  
  please make test/install/commit after that.  I'm also thinking 5% is sufficient overhead now, 
  10% seems excessive - make test / install / commit after that.  Finally, cloud verification 
  should be super fast and just check md5sums via API to match the manifest, it may already do 
  that, if so done else do it then make test / install/commit.

> I also don't want any files to accumulate in the cloud backup, please confirm that is done or 
  if not implement it.

  Why does it say "Downloading parity files for verification" we shouldn't be downloading at this stage I believe?  At least not 
  downloading the fiels, maybe listing them to get md5 sum at most, print out what you do.  In all these strive for consistency of 
  output, terseness, and being clear / minimial with communicatoin but also incremental to show what's happening each step that 
  might cause a delay

> In rclone output it mentions seeing 2000 files in the list of ~700 that were synced, are we leaving stray files in the rclone backup or are these other unrelated files?

> Look at main.go -- there's a backup management system here that uses restic (see the DESIGN-SPEC.md) -- there's a Manager with a Run method but I don't
  think it's ever being called -- there's also a RunSnapshot() that does a snapshot of a hardcoded dir even though there's a config for BackupSource.  I'm
  changing the BackupSource from /Volumes/fishbowl to /Users/pollmann and I want it to actually be configurable (cmdline) and not hardcoded -- ok if the
  cmdline has a default of $HOME.  Remove any unused functions in this script.

> remove 'fallback to /Users/pollmann' -- this is not a generally useful fallback.  Is repopath in config?  If so should runShapshot take both repoPath and
  config?  Also why would runSnapshot only run once if there are multiple BackupSources?

> Are there any other unused functions?  Can you use any common go tooling to find them?  Deadcode I think.

> Can you run it again

> Great - you removed a *lot* of code just now.  Please systematically review each function that was removed.  For each function, find the new code that
  replaces it.  If it wasn't replaced, see if there is another implementation of similar functionality in the program.  Enumerate each function that was
  removed, its replacement function, and if there is now, please describe what functionality was removed from the codebase.

> For the removed function that wasn't replaced, Manager.downloadManifests, what was the purpose of that code, and is that purpose still accomplished in the
  new codebase.  If not, we should implement replacement functionality.

> make isn't working
